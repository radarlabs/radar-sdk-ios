/// A single producer of map content that can be toggled on/off independently.
///
/// Sources are stateless from the registry's perspective: the registry calls
/// `loadOverlays(near:span:)` whenever it wants fresh data (on enable, on
/// region change, on manual refresh). The source returns an `MapOverlayBundle`
/// of annotations and overlays to render.
///
/// Each source also owns its rendering: the map view's `MKMapViewDelegate`
/// iterates registered sources to find one that produced a given overlay or
/// annotation. This keeps each source self-contained — adding a new source is
/// one new file plus one line in `AppDelegate`.
///
/// Examples:
/// - `MonitoredRegionsSource` — `CLLocationManager.monitoredRegions`
/// - `NearbyGeofencesSource` — `Radar.searchGeofences(...)`
/// - `NearbyPlacesSource` — `Radar.searchPlaces(...)`
/// - `SyncedRegionSource` — SDK-cached sync region + entities
/// - `TripDestinationSource` — active trip's destination(s)
///
/// Note: there is no public `Radar.searchBeacons(...)` API. Synced beacons
/// surface via `SyncedRegionSource`; live-ranged beacons would require a
/// separate source subscribing to `RadarUser.beacons` updates.
