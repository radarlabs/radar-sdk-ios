# About these projects

This folder contains 6 Xcode projects that Radar uses to test the various integration methods for the SDK:

1. Swift app using CocoaPods
2. Swift app using Carthage
3. Swift app using Swift Package Manager
4. Objective-C app using CocoaPods
5. Objective-C app using Carthage
6. Objective-C app using Swift Package Manager

Each one simply installs the SDK and displays the SDK bundle's `MARKETING_VERSION`.
